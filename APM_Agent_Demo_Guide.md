🧠 Prediction Agent Forecasts:
- Traffic will increase 400% in next 30 minutes
- Database will hit connection limit in 15 minutes
- Checkout service will become bottleneck

🛠️ Remediation Agent Actions:
- Scale mobile API: 10 → 25 instances
- Increase DB connection pool: 100 → 200 connections
- Pre-warm CDN cache for top 1000 products
